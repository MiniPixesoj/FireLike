# FireLike

**FireLike** is an advanced tool for **Garena Free Fire** players, designed to provide **complete profile information** and the ability to **send automatic likes safely and legally**.

## How does it work?

You just need to enter the player's **ID** in the app. From there, FireLike accesses public information and shows you in seconds:

- ‚úÖ Player name, badges, clan, and level  
- ‚úÖ Details of the **Booyah Pass**: whether it was purchased or claimed  
- ‚úÖ Account creation date  
- ‚úÖ Last online time  
- ‚úÖ Information about the **clan leader**, clan ID, and number of members  
- ‚úÖ Player status: Was the player **banned**? Since when?  
- ‚úÖ Visual equipment: clothes, active skins, etc.  
- ‚úÖ Equipped **pet** details  
- ‚úÖ Current **likes** count on the profile

## üöÄ Automatic Likes

The main feature of FireLike is to **send likes to any player's profile**. This works through a system that is **automated but 100% legal**:

- Likes are sent from **real accounts** created individually  
- Free Fire **only allows 100 likes per profile per day**, so once the limit is reached, you must wait 24 hours to send more  
- The system ensures compliance with **official limits**, avoiding any risk of penalties  
- Every action is transparent: you can see the results in real time from the app  
- **The likes feature requires an API key**, which you can get for free in our Discord server (see Contributions section)
