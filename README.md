# FireLike

**FireLike** is an advanced tool for **Garena Free Fire** players, designed to offer **complete profile information** and the ability to **send automatic likes safely and legally**.

## How does it work?

You just need to enter the **player ID** in the app. From there, FireLike accesses public data and displays, within seconds:

- ✅ Player name, badges, clan, and level  
- ✅ **Booyah Pass** details: whether it was purchased or claimed  
- ✅ Account creation date  
- ✅ Last connection  
- ✅ **Clan leader** info, clan ID, member count  
- ✅ Player status: has the player been **banned**? Since when?  
- ✅ Visual equipment: clothing, active skins, etc.  
- ✅ Equipped **pet** data  
- ✅ Current **likes count** on the profile

## 🚀 Automatic Likes

FireLike's main feature is to **send likes to any player's profile**. This is done via a **100% legal automated system**:

- Likes are sent from **real accounts**, each created individually  
- Free Fire **only allows 100 likes per profile per day**, so once the limit is reached, you must wait 24 hours to send again  
- The system ensures **compliance with official limits**, avoiding any risk of penalties  
- Every action is transparent: you can see results in real time from the app
